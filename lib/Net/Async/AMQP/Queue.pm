=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 listen

Starts a consumer on this queue.

 $q->listen(
  channel => $ch,
  ack => 1
 )->then(sub {
  my ($q, $ctag) = @_;
  print "Queue $q has ctag $ctag\n";
  ...
 })

Expects the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * channel - which channel to listen on

=item * ack (optional) - true to enable ACKs

=item * consumer_tag (optional) - specific consumer tag

=back

Returns a L<Future> which resolves with ($queue, $consumer_tag) on
completion. If this is cancelled before we receive the Basic.ConsumeOk
acknowledgement from the server, we'll issue an explicit cancel.

=cut

sub listen {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = @_;

	my $ch = delete $args{channel} or die "No channel provided";
	$self->{channel} = $ch;

    # Attempt to bind after we've successfully declared the exchange.
    retain_future($self->future->then(sub {

        );
		$ch->closure_protection($f);
        $ch->send_frame($frame);
        $f;
    }));
}

=head2 cancel

Cancels the given consumer.

 $q->cancel(
  consumer_tag => '...',
 )->then(sub {
  my ($q, $ctag) = @_;
  print "Queue $q ctag $ctag cancelled\n";
  ...
 })

Expects the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * consumer_tag (optional) - specific consumer tag

=back

Returns a L<Future> which resolves with ($queue, $consumer_tag) on
completion.

=cut

sub cancel {

=head2 consumer

Similar to L</listen>, but applies the event handlers so you can just provide an C<on_message> callback.

Takes the following extra named parameters:

=over 4

=item * on_message - callback for message handling

=item * on_cancel - will be called if the consumer is cancelled (either by the server or client)

=back

For server consumer cancellation notification, you'll need consumer_cancel_notifications:

 $mq->connect(
  ...
  client_properties => {
   capabilities => {
    'consumer_cancel_notify' => Net::AMQP::Value->true
   },
  },
 )

The on_message callback receives the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * type

=item * payload - scalar containing the raw binary data for this message

=item * consumer_tag - which consumer tag received this message

=item * delivery_tag - the delivery information for L<Net::Async::AMQP::Channel/ack>

=item * routing_key - routing key used for this message

=item * properties - any properties for the message

=item * headers - custom headers

=back

Properties include:

=over 4

=item * correlation_id - user-specified ID that can be used to link related messages, see
L<Net::Async::RPC::Client> for details.

=item * reply_to - user-specified target queue to which any replies should be sent

=item * content_type - payload format

=item * content_encoding - any encoding applied to the payload (gzip etc.)

=item * delivery_mode - delivery persistence - 1 for default, 2 for permanent

=item * priority - message priority, ranges from 0..255

=item * expiration - when this message (would have) expired

=item * message_id - user-specified ID

=item * timestamp - when the message was published, usually the time in seconds

=item * user_id - custom user-id info

=item * app_id - user-specified application information

=back

See C<examples/alternative-consumer.pl> for a usage example.

=head2 bind_exchange
