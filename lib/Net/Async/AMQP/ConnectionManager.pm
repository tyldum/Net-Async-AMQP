=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Channel management

Each connection has N total available channels, recorded in a hash. The total number
of channels per connection is negotiated via the initial AMQP Tune/TuneOk sequence on
connection.

We also maintain lists:

=over 4

=item * Unassigned channel - these are channels which were in use and have now been released.

=item * Closed channel - any time a channel is closed, the ID is pushed onto this list so we can reopen it later without needing to scan the hash, contains arrayrefs of [$mq_conn, $id]

=back

Highest-assigned ID is also recorded per connection.

 if(have unassigned) {
 	return shift unassigned
 } elsif(have closed) {
 	my $closed = shift closed;
 	return $closed->{mq}->open_channel($closed->{id})
 } elsif(my $next_id = $mq->next_id) {
 	return $mq->open_channel($next_id)
 } else {
 
 }

Calling methods on the channel proxy will establish
a cycle for the duration of the pending request.
This cycle will not be resolved until after all
the callbacks have completed for a given request.

The channel object does not expose any methods that allow
altering QoS or other channel state settings. These must be
requested on channel assignment. This does not necessarily
mean that any QoS change will require allocation of a new
channel.

Bypassing the proxy object to change QoS flags is not recommended.

=head2 Connection pool

Connections are established on demand.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

sub configure {
	my ($self, %args) = @_;
	for(qw(channel_retry_count connect_timeout)) {
		$self->{$_} = delete $args{$_} if exists $args{$_};
	}
	$self->SUPER::configure(%args);
}

=head2 request_channel

Attempts to assign a channel with the given QoS settings.

Available QoS settings are:

=over 4

=item * prefetch_count - number of messages that can be delivered at a time

=item * prefetch_size - total size of messages allowed before acknowledging

=item * confirm_mode - explicit publish ack

=back

Confirm mode isn't really QoS but it fits in with the others since it modifies
the channel state (and once enabled, cannot be disabled without closing and
reopening the channel).

Will resolve to a L<Net::Async::AMQP::ConnectionManager::Channel> instance on success.

=head2 can_reopen_channels

A constant which indicates whether we can reopen channels. The AMQP0.9.1
spec doesn't seem to explicitly allow this, but it works with RabbitMQ 3.4.3
(and probably older versions) so it's enabled by default.

=cut

sub can_reopen_channels { 1 }

=head2 channel_retry_count

Returns the channel retry count. The default is 10, call L</configure>
with undef to retry indefinitely, 0 to avoid retrying at all:

 # Keep trying until it works
 $mq->configure(channel_retry_count => undef);
 # Don't retry at all
 $mq->configure(channel_retry_count => 0);

=head2 connect_timeout

Returns the current connection timeout. undef/zero means "no timeout".

=cut

sub connect_timeout { shift->{connect_timeout} }

=head2 apply_qos

Set QoS on the given channel.

Expects the L<Net::Async::AMQP::Channel> object as the first
parameter, followed by the key/value pairs corresponding to
the desired QoS settings:

=over 4

=item * prefetch_count - number of messages that can be delivered before ACK
is required

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to the original 
L<Net::Async::AMQP::Channel> instance.
