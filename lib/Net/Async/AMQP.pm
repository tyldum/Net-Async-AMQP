=head1 NAME

Net::Async::AMQP - provides client interface to AMQP using L<IO::Async>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 use Net::Async::AMQP;
 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
 $loop->add(my $amqp = Net::Async::AMQP->new);
 $amqp->connect(
   host => 'localhost',
   user => 'guest',
   pass => 'guest',
 )->get;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Does AMQP things. Note that the API may change before the stable 1.000
release - L</ALTERNATIVE AMQP IMPLEMENTATIONS> are listed below if you want
to evaluate other options.

If you want a higher-level API which manages channels and connections, try
L<Net::Async::AMQP::ConnectionManager>.

Examples are in the C<examples/> directory.

=head2 AMQP support

The following AMQP features are supported:

=over 4

=item * Queue declare, bind, delete

=item * Exchange declare, delete

=item * Consumer setup and cancellation

=item * Message publishing

=item * Explicit ACK

=item * QoS

=item * SSL

=back

=head2 RabbitMQ-specific features

RabbitMQ provides some additional features:

=over 4

=item * Exchange-to-exchange binding

=item * Server flow control notification

=item * Consumer cancellation notification

=back

=head2 Missing features

The following features aren't currently implemented - raise a request via RT or by email (L</AUTHOR>)
if you want any of these:

=over 4

=item * Transactions

=item * Flow control

=item * SASL auth

=back

This implementation is designed to handle many simultaneous channels and connections. If you just want a
single consumer/publisher, one of the librabbitmq-c implementations may be sufficient.

=head1 CONSTANTS

=head2 AUTH_MECH

Defines the mechanism used for authentication. Currently only AMQPLAIN
is supported.

=cut

use constant AUTH_MECH             => 'AMQPLAIN';

=head2 PAYLOAD_HEADER_LENGTH

Length of header used in payload messages. Defined by the AMQP standard
as 8 bytes.

=cut

use constant PAYLOAD_HEADER_LENGTH => 8;

=head2 MAX_FRAME_SIZE

Largest amount of data we'll attempt to send in a single frame. Actual
frame limit will be negotiated with the remote server. Defaults to 262144.

=cut

use constant MAX_FRAME_SIZE        => 262144;

=head2 MAX_CHANNELS

Maximum number of channels to request. Defaults to the AMQP limit (65535).
Attempting to set this any higher will not end well, it's an unsigned 16-bit
value.

=cut

use constant MAX_CHANNELS          => 65535;

=head2 HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL

Interval in seconds between heartbeat frames, zero to disable. Can be
overridden by C<PERL_AMQP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL> in the environment, default
is 0 (disabled).

=cut

use constant HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL    => $ENV{PERL_AMQP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL} // 0;

use Net::Async::AMQP::Channel;
use Net::Async::AMQP::Queue;
use Net::Async::AMQP::Utils;

=head1 PACKAGE VARIABLES

=head2 $XML_SPEC

This defines the path to the AMQP XML spec, which L<Net::AMQP> uses
to create methods and handlers for the appropriate version of the MQ
protocol.

Defaults to an extended version of the 0.9.1 protocol as used by RabbitMQ,
this is found in the C<amqp0-9-1.extended.xml> distribution sharedir (see
L<File::ShareDir>).

Normally, you should be able to ignore this. If you want to load an alternative
spec, note that (a) this is global, rather than per-instance, (b) it needs to
be set before you C<use> this module.

 BEGIN { $Net::Async::AMQP::XML_SPEC = '/tmp/amqp.xml' }
 use Net::Async::AMQP;

Once loaded, this module will not attempt to apply the spec again.

=cut

our $XML_SPEC;
our $SPEC_LOADED;
BEGIN {
	$XML_SPEC //= File::ShareDir::dist_file(
		'Net-Async-AMQP',
		'amqp0-9-1.extended.xml'
	);

	# Load the appropriate protocol definitions. RabbitMQ uses a
	# modified version of AMQP 0.9.1
	Net::AMQP::Protocol->load_xml_spec($XML_SPEC) unless $SPEC_LOADED++;
}

=head1 %CONNECTION_DEFAULTS

The default parameters to use for L</connect>. Changing these values is permitted,
but do not attempt to delete from or add any entries to the hash.

Passing parameters directly to L</connect> is much safer, please do that instead.

=cut

our %CONNECTION_DEFAULTS = (
	port => 5672,
	host => 'localhost',

L<Future> for the current incoming message (received in two or more parts:
the header then all body chunks).

=cut

sub incoming_message { shift->{incoming_message} }

=head1 METHODS - Internal

The following methods are intended for internal use. They are documented
for completeness but should not normally be needed outside this library.

=cut

=head2 heartbeat_interval

Current maximum interval between frames.

=cut

sub heartbeat_interval { shift->{heartbeat_interval} //= HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL }

=head2 missed_heartbeats_allowed

How many times we allow the remote to miss the frame-sending deadline in a row
before we give up and close the connection. Defined by the protocol, should be
3x heartbeats.

=cut

sub missed_heartbeats_allowed { 3 }

=head2 apply_heartbeat_timer

Enable both heartbeat timers.

sub heartbeat_send_timer { shift->{heartbeat_send_timer} }

=head2 handle_heartbeat_failure

Called when heartbeats are enabled and we've had no response from the server for 3 heartbeat
intervals (see L</missed_heartbeats_allowed>). We'd expect some frame from the remote - even
if just a heartbeat frame - at least once every heartbeat interval so if this triggers then
we're likely dealing with a dead or heavily loaded server.

This will invoke the L</heartbeat_failure event> then close the connection.

=head2 send_frame

Send a single frame.

Takes the $frame instance followed by these optional named parameters:

=over 4

=item * channel - which channel we should send on

=back

Returns a L<Future> which will resolve to an empty list
when the frame has been written (this does not guarantee that the server has received it).

=cut

	$self->write(
		$data,
	)->on_done($self->curry::reset_heartbeat)
}

=head2 header_bytes

Byte string representing the header bytes we should send on initial TCP connect.
Net::AMQP uses AMQP\x01\x01\x09\x01, which does not appear to comply with AMQP 0.9.1
section 4.2.2.

=cut

sub header_bytes { "AMQP\x00\x00\x09\x01" }

sub _add_to_loop {
	my ($self, $loop) = @_;
	$self->debug_printf("Added %s to loop", $self);

	my $f = $self->loop->new_future;
	while(my ($k, $v) = splice @_, 0, 2) {
		$f->can($k) ? $f->$k($v) : die "Unable to call method $k on $f";
	}
	$f
}

1;

__END__

=head1 EVENTS

The following events may be raised by this class - use
L<Mixin::Event::Dispatch/subscribe_to_event> to watch for them:

 $mq->bus->subscribe_to_event(
   heartbeat_failure => sub {
	 my ($ev, $last) = @_;
	 print "Heartbeat failure detected\n";
   }
 );

=head2 connected event

Called after the connection has been opened.

=head2 close event

Called after the remote has closed the connection.

=head2 heartbeat_failure event

Raised if we receive no data from the remote for more than 3 heartbeat intervals and heartbeats are enabled,

=head2 unexpected_frame event

If we receive an unsolicited frame from the server this event will be raised:

 $mq->bus->subscribe_to_event(
  unexpected_frame => sub {
   my ($ev, $type, $frame) = @_;
   warn "Frame type $type received: $frame\n";
  }
 )

=head1 ALTERNATIVE AMQP IMPLEMENTATIONS

As usual there's a few other options:

=over 4

=item * L<Net::RabbitMQ> - basic bindings for librabbitmq

=item * L<Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ> - a fork of Net::RabbitMQ ("uses a newer version of librabbitmq and fixes some bugs")

=item * L<Net::RabbitMQ::Client> - yet another set of bindings for librabbitmq, includes a "Simple" wrapper implementation as well

=item * L<Crixa> - wrapper over L<Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ>

=item * L<Net::RabbitMQ::Channel> - another wrapper around L<Net::RabbitMQ>

=item * L<Net::RabbitMQ::Java> - uses the official Java client via L<Inline::Java>

=item * L<Net::Thumper> - sync client based on L<Net::AMQP>, no channel support

=item * L<POE::Component::Client::AMQP> - provides a L<POE> component based on L<Net::AMQP>.

=item * L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ> - uses L<Net::AMQP> to provide an L<AnyEvent> implementation.

=item * L<Net::RabbitFoot> - wrapper around L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ>

=item * L<AnyMQ::AMQP> - provides AMQP support for the L<AnyMQ> abstraction, via L<AnyEvent::RabbitMQ>

=back

Modules based on librabbitmq-c are probably fine for simple sync tasks, but I wouldn't recommend them for
any async work. In contrast, the L<Net::AMQP> protocol module generates all the classes and methods directly
from the AMQP spec, so it's an excellent base on which to develop the transport module (as in the case of
L<Net::Async::AMQP>).

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item * L<Net::AMQP> - this does all the hard work of converting the XML protocol
specification into appropriate Perl methods and classes.

=item * L<Net::RabbitMQ::Management::API> - doesn't do AMQP, but provides sync (LWP-based) access to RabbitMQ's HTTP API

=item * L<Test::Net::RabbitMQ> - provides a basic server implementation for testing
