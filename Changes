	API CHANGES:
	* The Net::Async::AMQP class is now an IO::Async::Notifier, to bring it in line with
	other IO::Aync code. One side effect of this change is that events are now raised through
	a message bus rather than directly on the Net::Async::AMQP instance itself.

	Existing code will need to change this:

	 my $amqp = Net::Async::AMQP->new(loop => $loop);

	to this:

	 $loop->add->(my $amqp = Net::Async::AMQP->new);

	and this:

	 $amqp->subscribe_to_event(...);

	to this:

	 $amqp->bus->subscribe_to_event(...);

	New features:
	* Connection manager for automatically connecting and assigning channels
	* Some loadtesting scripts, for performance+stability testing on the server
	implementation (not available yet, should be in the next release)

	Bugs fixed:
	* If we establish TCP connection but fail to negotiate auth with server,
	previously this would leave the connection future unresolved. It will now
	fail with a message indicating that the remote closed the connection.
	* Net::AMQP was generating an invalid initial connection header
	(AMQP\x01\x01$major$minor rather than AMQP\x00$major$minor$rev as the
	AMQP 0.9.1 spec seems to require), we now generate our own header.
	RabbitMQ seems happy with either.

	Bugs fixed:
	* Connection close sends a real connection close, rather than a channel close request

0.002     2014-02-27 07:10:14+00:00 Europe/London
	New features:
	* Support parameters when declaring queues (passive, durable, exclusive)
